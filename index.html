		<p>Hello my name is Amanda Auld! I am from Fresno, California and I am a
			Communication Design major. I enjoy creating digital art, stickers, and
			tee shirt designs. I also play the bass and I do Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I
			look forward to learning how to customize my website and make it my own.
		I am excited to learn how to create some cool features for my website. I
	hope that I can use the skills I learn in this class to create some sort of
portfolio website or online shop to sell some of my sticker and tee shirt designs.  </p>

		<p>This is my website</p>
