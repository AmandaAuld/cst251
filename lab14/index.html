      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p> The purpose of this lab was to use block-level and typography CSS
        to recreate a webpage.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I had some trouble with positioning just like in lab 13. I had to mess
        around with it a lot to get it to look how I wanted it to. </p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>I re-created a webpage with css and block level styling. Although there
        are a few slight differences between my fake page and the original 
         I am very happy with the result and how close I was able to resemble
         the original.</p>
