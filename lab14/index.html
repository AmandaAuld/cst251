      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p> The purpose of this lab was to use block-level and typography CSS
        to recreate a webpage.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I struggled with positioning and centering text within buttons, I
        played around with it a lot until I was satisfied with the way the page
        looks. One of the buttons does move when the window is made smaller and
        I did not know how to fix that.</p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>I recreated the nuage app home page, and I am actually really satisfied
         with how it turned out. I was able to match to font closely, match the
         colors, and position the elements as similarly to the original as
         possible.</p>
