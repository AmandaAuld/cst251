		<h1>Lab Subject<h1/>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a page that had images and links
				 to different pages. The purpose was to also apply different methods of
				 displaying links such as linking both text and images.
 </p>
	 <h1>Problem<h1/>
		 <p>Since we already knew how to add images and we had the lecture to refer
			 back to we finished the lab with ease. When we got stuck we would look
			 back at the lecture powerpoint.
 </p>
	 <h1>Result<h1/>
		 <p>We created web pages that contain multiple images and display links
			 through images and text. We also added a link that takes you back to
			 the homepage from the lab page.
