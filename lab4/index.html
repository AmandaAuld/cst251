		<h1>Lab Subject<h1/>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to test our files locally and publish them
				to the server through Github. </p>
	 <h1>Problem<h1/>
		 <p>Fortunately we have been pushing our files to the server since Lab 2,
			 so we did not run into any problems. </p>
	 <h1>Result<h1/>
		 <p>We created a document describing the challenge, problems, and results
			 of the lab. We added heading, subheading, paragraph, and image tags and
			 then successfully published our files to the server through Github.</p>
