      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p> The purpose of this lab was to use CSS to style our lab page using
        block elements.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We did not have a lot of problems with the lab itself. We tested out
        different ways of styling our page content and image to find what worked for
        us. When we got stuck we referred back to the lecture or W3Schools.</p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>We created a lab page using CSS to style block elements. Our page content
        has a border, margins, padding, and a styled image.</p>
