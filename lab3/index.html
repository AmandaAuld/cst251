	<h1>Lab Subject<h1/>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to create well organized local file structures,
			 as well learning to add images and links within our website.</p>
 <h1>Problem<h1/>
	 <p>We had some trouble when inserting images because we had to resize them
		 and we continuously forgot to add closing tags.</p>
 <h1>Result<h1/>
	 <p>Thankfully, most of our file structure was already complete due to the
		  template we downloaded at the beginning of the class. In the end, we were
			able to add images to our pages as well as a bulleted list of our labs on
			our home pages. We also used techniques we already learned to add heading,
			subheading, and paragraph tags in order to create a well organized document.
			Overall, this lab strengthened our confidence and understanding of HTML
			and file structure.</p>
