			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to create our Lab 7 Index and create a style
				sheet to style it with.</p>
			<br>
	 <h2>Problem</h2>
		 <p>We had to experiment to figure out what looked good aesthetically to us.
			  We had trouble figuring out how to style our classes and IDs but referred
				 to W3 Schools for help. We also used the inspect feature to test
				 different elements and refine our page layout.  </p>
		 <br>
	 <h2>Result</h2>
		 <p> In the end we each created a stylized webpage complete with images,
			  colored backgrounds, margins, and borders. </p>
