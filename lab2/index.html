<h1>Hello world!</h1>

	<p>	My partner is Gabby. We met last semester when we had to do a group project
		together in our FYS 145 class. We found that we work well together, and we
		are excited for the opportunity to work together again as partners for
		CST251 Web Tools. We are both very new to coding, but we are looking forward
		to the chance to learn! Our attitudes towards education are very similar and
		we are both comfortable with taking on more leadership roles in classroom
		settings. We also both enjoy creating digital art and are Communication
		Design majors hoping to focus on visual design.
